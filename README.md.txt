# OrderProduct Project
This project is a database-driven application for managing product orders. It utilizes:
- **MySQL**: For relational data storage (products, inventories, orders, etc.)
- **MongoDB**: For managing product reviews in a NoSQL structure
- **Spring Boot**: As middleware to interact with databases.

### Folder Structure
- `sql/mysql_q.sql`: MySQL script for database schema and CRUD operations.
- `sql/mongoDB_q.js`: JavaScript and MongoDB script for managing product reviews.
- `src/application.properties`: Configuration file for Spring Boot, detailing connections to MySQL and MongoDB.
